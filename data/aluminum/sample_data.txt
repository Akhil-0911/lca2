ALUMINUM LCA ASSESSMENT - SAMPLE DATA
========================================

This file contains sample data for testing the aluminum LCA assessment form.
Fill in each step with these values to test the system with realistic data
that differs from the demo template.

========================================
STEP 1: METAL TYPE
========================================
Metal Type: aluminum
(Select "Aluminum" from the dropdown)

========================================
STEP 2: PROCESS ROUTE
========================================
Process Route: primary
Is Metallurgy: Yes (Check the box)
Process Class: primary
Has Circularity: No (Uncheck the box)

Note: This differs from demo (which uses recycling/secondary)

========================================
STEP 3: PRODUCTION SCALE
========================================
Production Scale: 1000
(Enter "1000" - representing 1000 tons/year)

Note: Demo uses 500, this is double the scale

========================================
STEP 4: PRODUCTION DETAILS
========================================
Total Inputs: 200
Total Outputs: 160
Material Efficiency: 80.0
Secondary Material Fraction: 25

Note: Primary aluminum production with lower efficiency
Demo uses: 120/100/83.3/75

========================================
STEP 5: WASTE MANAGEMENT
========================================
Scrap Ratio: 20
Recycling Rate: 70
Waste Ratio: 12
Energy Recovery Rate: 35

Waste Streams (Check these boxes):
✓ Slag: Yes
✓ Dust: Yes  
✓ Water: Yes
✓ Offgas: Yes
✗ Tailings: No

Note: Primary production has more waste than recycling
Demo uses: 15/85/8/45 with different waste streams

========================================
STEP 6: RECYCLED CONTENT
========================================
Recycled Content: 25

Note: Primary aluminum has lower recycled content
Demo uses: 85

========================================
STEP 7: ENERGY SOURCE
========================================
Energy Source: mixed
(Select "Mixed Grid" from dropdown)

Note: Primary smelting often uses mixed grid power
Demo uses: renewable

========================================
STEP 8: TRANSPORT
========================================
Transport Mode: truck
Transport Distance: local
Custom Distance: 150

Note: Shorter transport distance for local market
Demo uses: ship/regional/250

========================================
STEP 9: END OF LIFE
========================================
End of Life Scenario: recycling
Recovery Rate: medium
Custom Recovery Rate: 75

Note: Lower recovery rate than demo
Demo uses: high/90

========================================
EXPECTED RESULTS COMPARISON
========================================

This sample represents PRIMARY aluminum production which should show:
- Higher carbon footprint than recycled aluminum
- More energy consumption (primary smelting is energy-intensive)
- Lower material efficiency
- More waste generation
- Higher environmental impact scores

Compared to demo data (secondary/recycled aluminum):
- Carbon footprint should be 3-5x higher
- Energy consumption should be 10-15x higher
- Waste generation should be 2-3x higher
- Overall sustainability score should be lower

========================================
TESTING SCENARIOS
========================================

SCENARIO A: Primary Aluminum (This file)
- Use values above for new aluminum production

SCENARIO B: Mixed Production (Modify step 6)
- Change Recycled Content to 50
- Should show intermediate results

SCENARIO C: Transport Variation (Modify step 8)
- Change to "international" and 2000km
- Should increase transport emissions

SCENARIO D: Energy Mix Change (Modify step 7)
- Change to "coal" for worst case
- Should significantly increase carbon footprint

========================================
VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS
========================================

1. Carbon Footprint: Should be 8-15 kg CO2-eq/kg aluminum
2. Energy Use: Should be 45-55 MJ/kg aluminum  
3. Water Use: Should be 15-25 L/kg aluminum
4. Waste Generation: Should be 2-4 kg/kg aluminum
5. Overall Score: Should be "Needs Improvement" or "Poor"

========================================
